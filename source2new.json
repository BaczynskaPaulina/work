For example, Gmail's desktop web app disregards information in the &lt;head&gt; all together. To make coding email templates easier, HubSpot coded email templates support a special style tag that gives designers the ability to write CSS that will be compiled and converted into inline CSS and will be added to the targeted elements. Any code added to a style tag with the ID of &lt;hs-inline-css&gt;, will be added to the targeted tags. For example, Microsoft Outlook will apply a default font-family to all text contained in &lt;td&gt; tags, unless you specify a font-family inline for that table column. The example below uses a &lt;hs-inline-css&gt; style tag to add a font-family to all the table columns in the template. Please note that any media queries should be included in a separate &lt;style&gt;, as they can not be made inline. NOTE: The data-hse-inline-css attribute on a &lt;style&gt; tag in the Edit &gt; Edit Head section of drag and drop template in place of hs-inline-css to achieve this same goal.

It is important to remember that the markup gets generated, based upon the form that you create in HubSpot. Label tags, placeholder attributes, help text, columns, and initial field values should all be controlled from within HubSpot's Form editor (Contacts &gt; Forms). The embed code generates a form tag and a div wrapper with an action attribute that submits to HubSpot via the Forms API submission endpoint. Each row of inputs is wrapped in a fieldset tag. Within the fieldset tags, there are React JS div tags that are used for progressive profiling and dependent form fields. Most fields render with label and input tags with help text in a div. Dropdown select fields have select and option tags, while other multi-select fields render their options with ul and li tags. You can learn more about the CSS selectors, below. Each input has a type attribute that indicates the type of field, in addition to an unique ID attribute. Validation error messages render within a within a ul, li, and label tag. At the end of the form, there is a hidden field named hs_context that collects contextual information (such as the user's user token cookie: hubspot_utk) in a JSON block, passes it as part of the submission.
